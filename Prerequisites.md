# Prerequisites

Before I started any lab, we were taught how to open the **Google Cloud Console** for the lab and How to activate the **Google Cloud Shell** for command line programming when needed.

### Google Cloud Console

It is the Google Cloud Graphical User Interface that allows us to interact with the cloud. It has a navigation bar that allows easy wayfinding and a search bar for easy traversal through the cloud.

### Google Cloud Shell

It is the Google Cloud Command Line Interface that also allows us to interact with the cloud through *code*. Cloud Shell is a free online environment, with command-line access for managing your infrastructure and an online code editor for cloud development.
