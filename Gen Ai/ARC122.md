# Analyze Images with the Cloud Vision API: Challenge Lab

# Theory

This was my first challenge lab in the program and we were to implement the learnings of labs GSP075(**Extract, Analyze, and Translate Text from Images with the Cloud ML APIs**) and GSP277(**APIs Explorer: Qwik Start**)

## Challenge Scenario

You are just starting your junior machine learning engineer role. So far you have been helping teams train models, and you're learning how to use Google Cloud Machine Learning APIs.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks.


## What we did

In this lab,We:-
1. Used the Vision API and called it using *curl* to detect text and global landmarks in a given image. 
2. Created a request.json file and updated it accordingly
3. Uploaded the Output to Cloud Storage
