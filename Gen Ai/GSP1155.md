# Vertex AI PaLM API: Qwik Start

# Theory

The **Vertex AI PaLM API** enables you to test, customize, and deploy instances of Google's PaLM large language models (LLM) so that you can leverage the capabilities of PaLM in your applications. The PaLM family of models supports text completion and multi-turn chat.

For chat API calls, the *context, examples, and messages* combine to form the prompt

## What we did

In this lab,We learnt how to use the PaLM family of models to suport:

1. Text completion use cases
2. Multi-turn chat integration. 

We gave data into the model and gave it a test input to check how the AI would perform. We also created a conversation where we gave contexts and based on the same, the AI would give responses.

## New terms 

1. **Ideation** -- Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and a wealth of other ideation techniques.

2. **Summarization** -- 
Summarising methods teach you how to select text, reduce it to its main points, and to restate it in as few words as possible
