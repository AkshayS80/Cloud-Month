# My Cloud Month (August and September) --> My Experience in Azure Fundamentals Challenge and Google Cloud Study Jams

I just had my Cloud month where I finally plunged into the expansive world of the cloud in both Microsoft and Google.
This is a repository contains all that I learnt as a part of the **Azure Fundamentals Challenge** and **Google Cloud Study Jams** programs. It consists mostly of quick notes of Google Cloud Platform Services for revision of topics and recall.

## Azure Fundamentals Cloud Skills Challenge

A little while back, I had the amazing oppourtunity to participate in the **Azure Fundamentals Challenge**, a Microsoft Learn Cloud Skills Challenge, where we would learn the basics of Cloud Computing and unravel the potential of Azure. Through this program, I was able to explore Azure architecture, discover the core concepts of Azure including, virtual machines, storage, networking, and identity and understand management and governance resources for effective cloud and on-premises resource management through Modules, Hands-on experience and Quizzes.

## Google Cloud Study Jams

I also recently was selected as a participant in the **Google Cloud Study Jams** program where we would learn the basics of Google Cloud and Generative AI through modules filled with videos, labs and quizzes. 

### Gen AI Arcade

This was the one of the two programs of the **Google Cloud Study Jams** program. It was part of the **Google Cloud:The Arcade** Program and now considering its importance in the techno-sphere, they have integrated it into this program as well.

### Google Cloud Computing Foundations

This was the second of the two programs of **Google Cloud Study Jams** program. It was the beginner's guide to Google Cloud and gave us a deep dive into many Google Cloud Platform Services like APIs, Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Buckets,etc. The Google Cloud Computing Foundations courses are for individuals with little to no background or experience in cloud computing. They provide an overview of concepts central to cloud basics, big data, and machine learning, and where and how Google Cloud fits in.
