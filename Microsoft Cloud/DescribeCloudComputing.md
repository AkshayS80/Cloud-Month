### What is Azure??

Microsoft Azure is a continually growing cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services designed to assist you in creating solutions tailored to your business objectives. Azure's services cater to a spectrum of needs, ranging from straightforward to intricate. It provides uncomplicated web services for hosting your business's online presence in the cloud and also facilitates the operation of completely virtualized computers to manage your customized software solutions.

### Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services encompass standard IT resources such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. In addition, cloud services go beyond the conventional IT offerings to encompass technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

The distinguishing feature of cloud computing is its utilization of the internet to deliver these services, freeing it from the limitations of physical infrastructure, unlike a traditional datacenter. Consequently, if there's a need for swift expansion of your IT resources, you're not required to wait for the construction of a new datacenter; instead, you can leverage the cloud to rapidly augment your IT capacity.

### Shared Responsibility Model

The shared responsibility model makes sure that these responsibilities of cloud get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider. The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter, so it wouldn’t make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.

At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud. (You wouldn’t want the cloud provider to be able to read your information.) The consumer is also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it. Then, for some things, the responsibility depends on the situation

With an on-premises datacenter, you’re responsible for everything. With cloud computing, those responsibilities shift.

### Define Cloud Models
The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.

1. Public: A private cloud refers to an internet-based IT service delivery system exclusively utilized by a single organization. This private cloud offers significantly enhanced control to the company and its IT department. Nevertheless, it entails higher expenses and offers fewer advantages compared to a public cloud arrangement. Furthermore, a private cloud can be established within your organization's on-site data center or within a dedicated offsite data center, which might even be managed by a third party exclusively for your company's use.

2. Private: A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

3. Hybrid: A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources

There is another Special Model: **Multi-Cloud**

In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

### Azure Arc 

Microsoft provides a service called Azure Arc, which is a set of technologies that helps you manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc offers assistance in overseeing your cloud setup, be it a public cloud exclusively on Azure, a private cloud within your datacenter, a blend of both (hybrid), or even a multi-cloud setup that operates across various cloud providers simultaneously.

### Consumption Based Model

Cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:
1. No upfront costs.
2. No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
3. The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
4. The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

### Cloud Pricing Model

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. It is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter. Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them. The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you. The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.
