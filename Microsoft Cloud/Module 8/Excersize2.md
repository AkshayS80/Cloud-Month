# Estimate workload costs by using the Pricing calculator

## Overview
In this exercise, you use the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator to compare the cost of running a sample workload in your datacenter versus on Azure.

Assume you're considering moving some of your on-premises workloads to the cloud. But first, you need to understand more about moving from a relatively fixed cost structure to an ongoing monthly cost structure.
You'll need to investigate whether there are any potential cost savings in moving your datacenter to the cloud over the next three years. You need to take into account all of the potentially hidden costs involved with operating on-premises and in the cloud.
Instead of manually collecting everything you think might be included, you use the TCO Calculator as a starting point. You adjust the provided cost assumptions to match your on-premises environment.
