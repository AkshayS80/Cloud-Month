# Module 3: Describe cloud service types

This is the Third Module of the Azure Fundementals Challenge

## Objectives

1. Describe Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
2. Describe Platform as a Service (PaaS).
3. Describe Software as a Service (SaaS).
4. Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

## Cloud Services Types

Cloud services are applications and infrastructure resources that exist on the internet. Third-party providers conclude contracts with subscribers for these services, allowing customers to leverage powerful computing resources without having to purchase or maintain hardware and software.

There are many types of Cloud Services that use different systems and infrastructure

### Infrastructure as a Service

**Infrastructure as a service** (IaaS) stands out as the most **versatile** class of cloud services, offering you the utmost control over your cloud assets. IaaS entails renting the hardware within a cloud datacenter, leaving the usage and management of that hardware entirely in your hands. **IaaS** places the **largest** share of responsibility with you. 

##### Scenarios

Here are some scenarios where IaaS would make sense:-
1. Lift-and-shift migration
2. Testing and development

### Platform as a Service

**Platform as a service** (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). In a PaaS setup, you don't need to concern yourself with licensing or updating operating systems and databases. PaaS offers a hassle-free development environment, sparing you from the complexities of maintaining all the development infrastructure. With PaaS, the responsibility is shared between you and the cloud provider.

##### Scenarios

Here are some scenarios where PaaS would make sense:-
1. Development framework
2. Analytics or business intelligence

### Software as a Service

**Software as a service** (SaaS) stands out as the most comprehensive cloud service model when considering it from a product standpoint.With SaaS, you're basically renting or using a ready-made application. Examples include email, financial software, messaging, and connectivity tools. SaaS is the easiest to set up and use, but it's less flexible and doesn't require much technical knowledge.

##### Scenarios

Here are some scenarios where SaaS would make sense:-
1. Email and messaging.
2. Business productivity applications.
3. Finance and expense tracking.
