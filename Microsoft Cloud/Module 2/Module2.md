2. Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud.
3. Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud.
4. Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud.

## Benefits

There are many benefits to the cloud which we must understand to truly appreciate the necessity of the cloud.

### High Availability and Scalability

The two of the biggest considerations of building or deploying a cloud application, are uptime (or availability) and the ability to handle demand (or scale).

1. High Availability

High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. When you’re deploying an application, a service, or any IT resources, it’s important the resources are available when needed. Azure is a cloud environment known for its exceptional availability, and the specific uptime assurances vary depending on the particular service in use. When designing your solution, it's important to feel assured of service availability.

2. Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. In the event of a sudden surge in traffic that overwhelms your systems, the capability to scale allows you to augment your resources, enhancing your capacity to effectively manage the heightened demand.

You won't have to worry about overpaying your services since you only pay for what you use, regardless of whether you use more at one time and less resources in the other.

There are two types of Scaling:-
1. Vertical
Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources.
2. Horizontal
Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.

### Reliability and Predictability

1. Reliability: 

Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. 
Due to its decentralized architecture, the cloud inherently provides a dependable and robust infrastructure. Through this decentralized design, the cloud allows you to distribute resources across various regions worldwide. This global scale ensures that in the event of a catastrophic incident in one region, other regions remain operational and unaffected.

2. Predictability
To predict is to say or estimate that (a specified thing) will happen in the future or will be a consequence of something. Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. 

We can look at it from 2 angles: 

1. Cost 
Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. Utilizing cloud technology allows you to observe your resource utilization in a live manner, oversee resources to guarantee their optimal usage, and employ data analytics to identify recurring patterns and trends. This information can then be leveraged to enhance your resource deployment strategies.

2. Performance
Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. **Autoscaling**, **load balancing**, and **ensuring high availability** are among the cloud principles that contribute to maintaining predictable performance. In the event of an abrupt surge in resource requirements, autoscaling can swiftly allocate additional resources to match the demand, and subsequently reduce them when demand subsides. Alternatively, if traffic becomes concentrated in a specific region, load balancing can efficiently redistribute some of the excess load to less burdened areas.

### Security and Governance

1. Governance
Cloud governance is the process of defining, implementing, and monitoring a framework of policies that guides an organization's cloud operations
Cloud features support governance and compliance. Things like set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. Plus, you can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change. Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.

2. Security 
Cloud security is a collection of procedures and technology designed to address external and internal threats to business security. Organizations need cloud security as they move toward their digital transformation strategy and incorporate cloud-based tools and services as part of their infrastructure.Security measures can be adjusted to fit your organisation needs. 

### Managability

Cloud is Managble. It does so much for software without hardware all the while making it easily accessible for the world. While we appreciate this, we can divide Cloud managebility into two types:

1. Management of the Cloud:-

It speaks to managing your cloud resources. In a cloud environment, you have the capability to automatically adjust resource allocation according to demand and set up resources using a pre-established template, eliminating the necessity for manual setup. The system can also constantly assess the well-being of resources and automatically substitute any that are malfunctioning. Additionally, it can send you real-time alerts based on predefined metrics to keep you informed about performance issues.

2. Management in the Cloud: Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage through a web portal or by using a command line interface or by using APIs or PowerShell. There are many options as seen here.
