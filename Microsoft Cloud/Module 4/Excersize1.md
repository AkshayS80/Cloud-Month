# Create an Azure resource

## Overview
In this exercise, youâ€™ll use the Azure portal to create a resource. The focus of the exercise is observing how Azure resource groups populate with created resources.

An Azure virtual machine is an on-demand, scalable computer resource that is available in Azure. Virtual machines are generally used to host applications when the customer requires more control over the computing environment than what is offered by other compute resources.

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

## Tasks Performed
1. Create a virtual machine
