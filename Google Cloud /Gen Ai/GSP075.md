# Extract, Analyze, and Translate Text from Images with the Cloud ML APIs

# Theory

This was the first time I was introduced to the Google Cloud Shell and how to make an API key

We first learnt the basics like how to 
1. list the active account with this command
```cmd
gcloud auth list
```
2. list the Project ID with this command
```cmd
gcloud config list project
```

## What we did

In this lab,We:-
1. Explored the power of machine learning by using multiple machine learning APIs together. 
2. Started with Cloud Vision API's text detection method to make use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images. 
3. Learnt how to translate that text with the Translation API and analyze it with the Natural Language API.

## New terms 

1. To send a request to the Vision API, we first need to generate the API key and then export it using the command below

```cmd
export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

2. **nano,vim,emacs**: All are built-in **Code editors** that allows you to browse file directories, and view and edit files, with continued access to the Cloud Shell.

3. **API key**:An application programming interface (API) key is a code used to identify and authenticate an application or user.
