# Analyze Images with the Cloud Vision API: Challenge Lab

# Theory

This was my first challenge lab in the program and we were to implement the learnings of labs GSP075(**Extract, Analyze, and Translate Text from Images with the Cloud ML APIs**) and GSP277(**APIs Explorer: Qwik Start**)

## Challenge Scenario

You are just starting your junior machine learning engineer role. So far you have been helping teams train models, and you're learning how to use Google Cloud Machine Learning APIs.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks.

You are requested to perform the following tasks:-
1. Use the Vision API and call it to detect text and global landmarks in a given image. 
2. Create a request.json file and update it accordingly
3. Upload the Output to Cloud Storage

Some standards you should follow:

1. Ensure that any needed APIs (such as Cloud Vision, Cloud Translation, and Cloud Natural Language) are successfully enabled.
2. Create all resources in the provided region, unless otherwise directed.
