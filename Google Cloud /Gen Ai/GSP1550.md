# Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design

## Theory

**The Vertex AI PaLM API** for text enables you to structure prompts however you like. You can add contextual information, instructions, examples, questions, lists, and any other types of text content that you can think of.

In this lab, you will learn about prompt design and various text generation use cases using the Vertex AI PaLM API.

**PaLM 2** is Google's next generation Large Language Model (LLM) that builds on Google's legacy of breakthrough research in machine learning and responsible AI. PaLM 2 excels at tasks like advanced reasoning, translation, and code generation because of how it was built.

Generative AI Studio and the Vertex AI PaLM API is powered by PaLM 2.


## What we did

In this Lab, we learnt:
1. How to use the Generative AI Studio UI:

<ul>
<li>Explore language offerings and Prompt Gallery</li>
<li>Creating different types of new prompts and getting responses in the UI
</li>
</ul>

2. How to use the Vertex AI PaLM API & Python SDK:

<ul>
<li>Background on LLMs and the PaLM API</li>
<li>Text generation examples</li>
<li>Exploring various model parameters involved in text generation</li>
<li>Chat model examples</li>
<li>Embedding model examples</li>
</ul>

This lab is organised across various Jupyter Notebooks and require us to call them and run the cells of the required files.
