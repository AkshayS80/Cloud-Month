# Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design

## Theory

**The Vertex AI PaLM API** for text enables you to structure prompts however you like. You can add contextual information, instructions, examples, questions, lists, and any other types of text content that you can think of.

In this lab, you will learn about prompt design and various text generation use cases using the Vertex AI PaLM API.

## What we did

In this Lab, we learnt:
1. How to get started with prompt engineering with the PaLM API:

<ul>
<li>Best practices</li>
<li>Zero-, one- and few-shot prompting</li>
</ul>

2. How to explore some text generation use cases with the PaLM API:

<ul>
<li>Ideation</li>
<li>Q&A</li>
<li>Text classification</li>
<li>Text extraction</li>
<li>Text summarization</li>
</ul>

This lab is organised across various Jupyter Notebooks and require us to call them and run the cells of the required files
