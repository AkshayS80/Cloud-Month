# Cloud SQL for MySQL: Qwik Start

## Theory
Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

Throughout this lab you'll be able to verify your work in the console by going to Navigation menu > Cloud Storage. You'll just need to refresh your browser after each command is run to see the new items you've created.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt how to:-
1. Create a Cloud SQL instance.
2. Connect to an instance using the mysql client in the Cloud Shell.

## New Terms 

To connect with a Cloud SQL instance
```cmd 
gcloud sql connect myinstance --user=root
```

This allows us to code in SQL in the Cloud Shell and interact with the database
