# Cloud Endpoints: Qwik Start

## Theory
Cloud Endpoints Frameworks is a web framework for the App Engine standard Python 2.7 and Java 8 runtime environments. Cloud Endpoints Frameworks provides the tools and libraries that allow you to generate REST APIs and client libraries for your application.

Like other web frameworks, Endpoints Frameworks handles the low-level communication details of HTTP requests and responses for your application. When a client sends a request to your API, Endpoints Frameworks routes the request's URL to the function or method in your code that processes the request. Endpoints Frameworks converts the return value to JSON and sends the response. You add metadata (by using annotations in Java and decorators in Python) to your source code. The metadata defines the surface of the REST APIs for your application.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt how to:-
1. Deploy the Cloud Endpoints configuration.
2. Deploy the API backend.
3. Send requests to the API.
4. Track API activity.
5. Add a quota to the API.

## New Terms 

1. We can send request to APIs through,

```cmd
./query_api.sh
```
2. Run this traffic generation script in Cloud Shell to populate the graphs and logs:

```cmd
./generate_traffic.sh
```
