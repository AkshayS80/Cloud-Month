# User Authentication: Identity-Aware Proxy

## Theory

Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is a Google Cloud Platform service that intercepts web requests sent to your application, authenticates the user making the request using the Google Identity Service, and only lets the requests through if they come from a user you authorize.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt how to:-
1. Use Python to write and deploy a simple App Engine app.
2. Enable and disable IAP to restrict access to your app.
3. Get user identify information from IAP into your app.
4. Cryptographically verify information from IAP to protect against spoofing.
