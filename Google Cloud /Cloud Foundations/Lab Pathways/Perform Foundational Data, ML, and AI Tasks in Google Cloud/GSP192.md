# Dataflow: Qwik Start - Templates

## Theory
Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully-managed cloud service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters in a simpler, more cost-efficient way. Operations that used to take hours or days take seconds or minutes instead. Create Cloud Dataproc clusters quickly and resize them at any time, so you don't have to worry about your data pipelines outgrowing your clusters.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt:-

1. Create a cluster
2. Submit a job
3. View the job output.

## Tasks Performed
1. Create a Cloud BigQuery dataset and table Using Cloud Shell
2. Create a Cloud BigQuery dataset and table using the Cloud Console
3. Run the pipeline
4. Submit a query

I did this lab twice to do both Step 1 and Step 2 since you can't do both in one lab.
