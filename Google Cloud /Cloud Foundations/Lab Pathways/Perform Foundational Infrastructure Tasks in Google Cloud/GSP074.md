# Cloud Storage: Qwik Start - CLI/SDK

## Theory
Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

Throughout this lab you'll be able to verify your work in the console by going to Navigation menu > Cloud Storage. You'll just need to refresh your browser after each command is run to see the new items you've created.

## What we did

In this hands-on lab, we learnt how to create a storage bucket, upload objects to it, create folders and subfolders in it, and make objects publicly accessible using the Google Cloud command line.

## Tasks Performed
1. Create a bucket
2. Upload an object into your bucket
3. Download an object from your bucket
4. Copy an object to a folder in the bucket
5. List contents of a bucket or folder
6. List details for an object
7. Make your object publicly accessible

## New Terms 

To remove an object from the bucket, we used the rm command:
```cmd 
rm hmmm.jpg
```
