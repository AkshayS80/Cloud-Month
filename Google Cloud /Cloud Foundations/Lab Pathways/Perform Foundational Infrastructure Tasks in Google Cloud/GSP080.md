# Cloud Functions: Qwik Start - Command Line

## Theory
A cloud function is a piece of code that runs in response to an event, such as an HTTP request, a message from a messaging service, or a file upload. Cloud events are things that happen in your cloud environment. These might be things like changes to data in a database, files added to a storage system, or a new virtual machine instance being created.

Since cloud functions are event-driven, they only run when something happens. This makes them a good choice for tasks that need to be done quickly or that don't need to be running all the time.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt:-

1. Create, deploy, and test a cloud function using the Google Cloud console.
2. View logs using

We created a function and a cloud storage bucket and we depolyed that function into the bucket. After which we tested and checked the data logs.

## Tasks Performed
1. Create a function
2. Create a cloud storage bucket
3. Deploy your function
4. Test the function
5. View logs
