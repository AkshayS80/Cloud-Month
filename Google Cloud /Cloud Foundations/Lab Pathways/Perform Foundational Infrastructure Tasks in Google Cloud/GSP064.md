# Cloud IAM: Qwik Start

## Theory
Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service lets you create and manage permissions for Google Cloud resources. Cloud IAM unifies access control for Google Cloud services into a single system and provides a consistent set of operations.

This is an introductory level lab. Little to no prior knowledge of Cloud IAM is expected. Experience with Cloud Storage is helpful to complete the tasks in this lab, but is not required. Make sure that you have a file in .txt or .html available. If you are looking for more advanced practice with Cloud IAM, be sure to check out the following Google Cloud Skills Boost lab, IAM Custom Roles.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt how to:-
1. Explore editor roles.
2. Prepare a resource for access testing.
3. Remove project access.
4. Add storage permissions.
5. Verify access.

We used two IDs and changed their respective roles and made sure that they were able to implement such changes after. Like ID 2 became an editor from viewer with access to change the bucket.
