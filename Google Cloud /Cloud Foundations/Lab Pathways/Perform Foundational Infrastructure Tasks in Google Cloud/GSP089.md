# Cloud Monitoring: Qwik Start

## Theory
Cloud Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. Cloud Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others. Cloud Monitoring ingests that data and generates insights via dashboards, charts, and alerts. Cloud Monitoring alerting helps you collaborate by integrating with Slack, PagerDuty, HipChat, Campfire, and more.

The Cloud Monitoring agent is a collected-based daemon that gathers system and application metrics from virtual machine instances and sends them to Monitoring. By default, the Monitoring agent collects disk, CPU, network, and process metrics. Configuring the Monitoring agent allows third-party applications to get the full list of agent metrics.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt:-

1. Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance with Cloud Monitoring
2. Install monitoring and logging agents for your VM which collects more information from your instance, which could include metrics and logs from 3rd party apps

## Tasks Performed
1. Create a Compute Engine instance
2. Add Apache2 HTTP Server to the instance
3. Create an uptime check
4. Create an alerting policy
5. Create a dashboard and chart
6. View your logs
7. Check the uptime check results and triggered alerts
