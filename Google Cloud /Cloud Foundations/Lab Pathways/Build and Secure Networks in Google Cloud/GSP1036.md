# Securing Virtual Machines using BeyondCorp Enterprise (BCE)

## Theory

BeyondCorp Enterprise - A zero trust solution that enables secure access to applications and resources, and offers integrated threat and data protection.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt how to:-

1. Enable IAP TCP forwarding in your Google Cloud project
2. Create Linux and Windows Instances
3. Test connectivity to your Linux and Windows instances
4. Configure the required firewall rules for BCE
5. Grant permissions to use IAP TCP forwarding
6. Demonstrate tunneling using SSH and RDP connections

## Tasks Performed
1. Enable IAP TCP forwarding in your Google Cloud project
2. Create Linux and Windows Instances
3. Test connectivity to your Linux and Windows instances
4. Configure the required firewall rules for BCE
5. Grant permissions to use IAP TCP forwarding
6. Use IAP Desktop to Connect to the Windows and Linux Instances
7. Demonstrate tunneling using SSH and RDP connections


## New Terms

1. **Remote Desktop Protocol** -- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), a secure network communication protocol offered by Microsoft, allows users to execute remote operations on other computers. It facilitates secure information exchange between remotely connected machines over an encrypted communication channel.

2. **IAP TCP** -- IAP's TCP forwarding feature allows users to connect to arbitrary TCP ports on Compute Engine instances. For general TCP traffic, IAP creates a listening port on the local host that forwards all traffic to a specified instance. IAP then wraps all traffic from the client in HTTPS.
