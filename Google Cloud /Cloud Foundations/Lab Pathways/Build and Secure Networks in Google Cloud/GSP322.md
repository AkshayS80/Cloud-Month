5. GSP1036 -- (**Securing Virtual Machines using BeyondCorp Enterprise (BCE)**)

## Challenge Scenario

You are a security consultant brought in by Jeff, who owns a small local company, to help him with his very successful website (juiceshop). Jeff is new to Google Cloud and had his neighbour's son set up the initial site. The neighbour's son has since had to leave for college, but before leaving, he made sure the site was running.

You need to help out Jeff and perform appropriate configuration for security.

You need to configure this simple environment securely. Your first challenge is to set up appropriate firewall rules and virtual machine tags. You also need to ensure that SSH is only available to the bastion via IAP.

For the firewall rules, make sure:

1. The bastion host does not have a public IP address.
2. You can only SSH to the bastion and only via IAP.
3. You can only SSH to juice-shop via the bastion.
4. Only HTTP is open to the world for juice-shop.
