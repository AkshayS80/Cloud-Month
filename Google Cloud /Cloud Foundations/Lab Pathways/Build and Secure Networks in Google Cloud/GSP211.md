# Multiple VPC Networks

## Theory
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network is a virtual version of a physical network that is implemented inside of Google's production network by using Andromeda. A VPC network does the following: Provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances.

Every instance in a VPC network has a default network interface. You can create additional network interfaces attached to your VMs. Multiple network interfaces enable you to create configurations in which an instance connects directly to several VPC networks (up to 8 interfaces, depending on the instance's type).

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt:-

1. Create custom mode VPC networks with firewall rules.
2. Use Compute Engine to create virtual machine instances.
3. Explore the connectivity for virtual machine instances across VPC networks.
4. Create a virtual machine instance with multiple network interfaces.

## Tasks Performed
1. Create custom mode VPC networks with firewall rules
2. Create VM instances
3. Explore the connectivity between VM instances
4. Create a VM instance with multiple network interfaces
