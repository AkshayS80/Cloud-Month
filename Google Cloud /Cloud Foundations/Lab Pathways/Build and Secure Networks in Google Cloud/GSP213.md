# VPC Networks - Controlling Access

## Theory
Cloud IAM lets you authorize who can take action on specific resources, giving you full control and visibility to manage cloud resources centrally. The following roles are used in conjunction with single-project networking to independently control administrative access to each VPC Network:

1. Network Admin: Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates.
2. Security Admin: Permissions to create, modify, and delete firewall rules and SSL certificates.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt:-

1. Create an NGINX web server.
2. Create tagged firewall rules.
3. Create a service account with IAM roles.
4. Explore permissions for the Network Admin and Security Admin roles.

## Tasks Performed
1. Create the web servers
2. Create the firewall rule
3. Explore the Network and Security Admin roles
4. Create a VM instance with multiple network interfaces
