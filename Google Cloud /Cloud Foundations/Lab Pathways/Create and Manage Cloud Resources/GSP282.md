# A Tour of Google Cloud Hands-on Labs

## Theory
Google Cloud is a suite of cloud services hosted on Google's infrastructure. From computing and storage, to data analytics, machine learning, and networking, Google Cloud offers a wide variety of services and APIs that can be integrated with any cloud-computing application or project, from personal to enterprise-grade.

A Google Cloud project is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources. It often contains resources and services; for example, it may hold a pool of virtual machines, a set of databases, and a network that connects them together. Projects also contain settings and permissions, which specify security rules and who has access to what resources.

A Project ID is a unique identifier that is used to link Google Cloud resources and APIs to your specific project. Project IDs are unique across Google Cloud: there can be only one qwiklabs-gcp-xxx...., which makes it globally identifiable.

## What we did

In this lab, we learnt about the following:

1. The lab platform, and how to identify key features of a lab environment
2. How to access the Cloud console with specific credentials
3. Google Cloud projects, and identify common misconceptions about them
4. How to use the Google Cloud Navigation menu to identify types of Google Cloud services
5. Basic roles, and use the Cloud IAM service to inspect actions available to specific users
6. The API library, and examine its chief features

## Tasks Performed

1. Accessing the Cloud Console
2. Projects in the Cloud console
3. Roles and permissions
4. APIs and services
5. Ending your lab
