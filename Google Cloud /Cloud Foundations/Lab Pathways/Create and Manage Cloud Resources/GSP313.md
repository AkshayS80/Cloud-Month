# Create and Manage Cloud Resources: Challenge Lab

## Overview

This is a challenge lab in the program and we were to implement the learnings of labs:-
1. GSP001 -- (**Creating a Virtual Machine**) 
2. GSP002 -- (**Getting Started with Cloud Shell and gcloud**)
3. GSP007 -- (**Set Up Network and HTTP Load Balancers**)
4. GSP100 -- (**Kubernetes Engine: Qwik Start**)
5. GSP282 -- (**A Tour of Google Cloud Hands-on Labs**)

## Challenge Scenario

You have started a new role as a Junior Cloud Engineer for Jooli, Inc. You are expected to help manage the infrastructure at Jooli. Common tasks include provisioning resources for projects.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so step-by-step guides are not provided.

Some Jooli, Inc. standards you should follow:

1. Create all resources in the default region or zone, unless otherwise directed.
2. Naming normally uses the format team-resource; for example, an instance could be named nucleus-webserver1.
3. Allocate cost-effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored, and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so plan carefully. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share: unless directed, use e2-micro for small Linux VMs, and use e2-medium for Windows or other applications, such as Kubernetes nodes
